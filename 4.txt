When reading in verses, we would need to split verses by space and internally track the occurrences of 
opening and closing tags \r and \r*.  Upon finding these tags, mark the start and end verses of the red letter region.
Consequently, we must modify the data structure of the Verse class to have 'redStart' and 'redEnd' member variables
which will be the word index of the corresponding Verse's word. 

Ex: for the input "\v In the \r beginning God created \r* the heavens and the earth."
The data structure would look like this:
class Verse:
  verseNum: 1
  words: [In, the, beginning, God, created, the, heavens, and, the, earth]
  redStart: 2 (inclusive)
  redEnd: 5 (exclusive)

This works for ranges that span verses as well.  We can do this by simply setting the redStart variable of the previous
verse and the redEnd variable of the next verse.

In terms of the UI, we can simply add a 'red' button in the editor as well as add an option when dragging to highlight on the preview.
